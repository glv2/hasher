#+TITLE: hasher

The active repository is at https://codeberg.org/glv/hasher

*hasher* is a command line tool to hash files and check file hashes. It is
basically a frontend for the hashing capabilities of the [[https://github.com/sharplispers/ironclad][Ironclad]] library.

* Standalone executable

To build the binary you will need a Common Lisp implementation (SBCL
recommended, CCL and ECL will work too but hashing will be much much slower),
ASDF and Ironclad. Then build with ~make~ (or ~make LISP=ccl~ to build using
CCL).

* Roswell

There is also a *hasher* [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][Roswell]] script in the /roswell/ directory. You can use
it directly with ~./hasher.ros ...~ or build the binary with
~ros dump executable hasher.ros~.
